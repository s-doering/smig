A simple but yet powerful migration plugin for Grails going a more lightweight
direction than the standard "Grails Database Migration Plugin".
This plugin leaves the database creation and update process in hibernates
skillful hands, but having an easy way to add, change, or delete data on
applications startup. Need to access your services? No problem. Use them as
you are used to it in Grails.

Simply create a migration file for every feature / task / story / fairy tale
you develop, put your changes there and on next startup the changes will be
made – once.
No need to maintain (and merge) a changes file.
